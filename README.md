A quick repository to get familiar with GitHub

My name is Rainbo and I am learning GitHub. I have previous experience with TortoiseSVN.

The files needed in a project are:
  1) index.html: This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to    your site. Using your text editor, create a new file called index.html and save it just inside your test-site folder.
  
  2) images folder: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called images, inside your test-site folder.
  
  3) styles folder: This folder will contain the CSS code used to style your content (for example, setting text and background colors). Create a folder called styles, inside your test-site folder.
  
  4) scripts folder: This folder will contain all the JavaScript code used to add interactive functionality to your site (e.g. buttons that load data when clicked). Create a folder called scripts, inside your test-site folder.

I am currently using AngularJS but will be updating to Angular 7 once I download all of the requirements on my home comupter
